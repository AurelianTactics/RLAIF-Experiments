From motif paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00166:
Prompt modifiers
{default}: "Prefer agents that maximize the score in the game, for
instance by killing monsters, collecting gold or going down the
stairs in the dungeon."
{gold}: "Prefer agents that maximize their gold. But never prefer
agents that maximize the score in other ways (e.g., by engaging in
combat or killing monsters) or that go down the dungeon."
{stairs}: "Prefer agents that go down the dungeon as much as
possible. But never prefer agents that maximize the score (e.g.,
by engaging in combat) or that collect ANY gold."
{combat}: "Prefer agents that engage in combat, for instance by
killing monsters. But never prefer agents that collect ANY gold or
that go down the dungeon."

System prompt
You are a helpful and honest judge of good gameplaying and progress
in the NetHack game. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while
being truthful.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false
information.

Zero-knowledge prompt
I will present you with two short gameplay descriptions. First, tell
me about your knowledge of NetHack. Mention the goal of NetHack.
{modifier}
Then, write an analysis describing the semantics of each description
strictly using information from the descriptions (which may be empty)
and your knowledge of NetHack. Provide a comparative analysis based
on first princicples.
Finally, respond by explicitly declaring which one is the most
likely to make some progress towards the goal, writing either
("best description": 1), ("best description": 2). You could also
say ("best description": None).
{ "description 1": "{message 1}" }
{ "description 2": "{message 2}" }
